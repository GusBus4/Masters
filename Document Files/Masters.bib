abstract = {As MAVs increase in functionality and utility, lightweight perception becomes critical to increasing autonomy. Cameras present an attractive solution for on-board sensing, due to their low weight, small power consumption, and dense information stream. High-speed stereo vision provides 3D data for obstacle avoidance, but generally has substantial processing requirements which are especially difficult to achieve on small aircraft. Here, we compare two solutions to this problem: dense stereo on an FPGA and sparse stereo on an ARM processor. We detail the design considerations and performance of both systems on duplicate fixed-wing aircraft platforms flying near obstacles in an outdoor environment.},

abstract = {An initial design concept for a micro-coaxial rotorcraft using custom manufacturing techniques and commercial off-the-shelf components is discussed. Issues associated with the feasibility of achieving hover and fully functional flight control at small scale for a coaxial rotor configuration are addressed. Results from this initial feasibility study suggest that it is possible to develop a small scale coaxial rotorcraft weighing approximately 100 gm, and that moment control is sufficient for roll, yaw and lateral trim. A prototype vehicle was built and its rotors were tested in a custom hover stand used to measure thrust and power. The best measured rotor Figure of Merit, 0.42, was obtained for a single rotor configuration. A blade element momentum theory (BEMT) model of the rotor was implemented, and airfoil characteristics were estimated from the rotor tests. The model showed that profile drag accounts for 45{\%} of the losses as opposed to 30{\%} in full-scale helicopters. The radio controlled vehicle was flown untethered with its own onboard power source and exhibited good flight stability and control dynamics.},

Based on recent findings on insects’ sensing abilities and control strategies, the BeeRotor robot was designed to use optic flow to perform complex tasks such as ground and ceiling following while also automatically driving its forward speed on the basis of the ventral or dorsal optic flow. In addition, the BeeRotor robot can perform tricky manoeuvers such as automatic ceiling docking by simply regulating its dorsal or ventral optic flow in high-roofed tunnel depicting natural scenes. Although it was built as a proof of concept, the BeeRotor robot is one step further towards achieving a fully-autonomous micro-helicopter which is capable of navigating mainly on the basis of the optic flo},

The control performance is studied by real time implementation of the control algorithms in an actual helicopter testbed. Since the decoupling matrix of the model helicopter is singular, the system is not decouplable by static state feedback, and it is challenging to design a feedback control system. Dynamic state feedback is applied. The controller is designed using a nonlinear structure algorithm. Furthermore, a parameter identification scheme is introduced in the closed-loop system to improve the control performance. Three identification methods are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@unpublished{Camrad,
abstract = {The Comprehensive Analytical Model of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics, CAMRAD, program is designed to calculate rotor performance, loads, and noise; helicopter vibration and gust response; flight dynamics and handling qualities; and system aeroelastic stability. The analysis is a consistent combination of structural, inertial, and aerodynamic models applicable to a wide range of problems and a wide class of vehicles. The CAMRAD analysis can be applied to articulated, hingeless, gimballed, and teetering rotors with an arbitrary number of blades. The rotor degrees of freedom included are blade/flap bending, rigid pitch and elastic torsion, and optionally gimbal or teeter motion. General two-rotor aircrafts can be modeled. Single main-rotor and tandem helicopter and sideby-side tilting proprotor aircraft configurations can be considered. The case of a rotor or helicopter in a wind tunnel can also be modeled. The aircraft degrees of freedom included are the six rigid body motion, elastic airframe motions, and the rotor/engine speed perturbations. CAMRAD calculates the load and motion of helicopters and airframes in two stages. First the trim solution is obtained; then the flutter, flight dynamics, and/or transient behavior can be calculated. The trim operating conditions considered include level flight, steady climb or descent, and steady turns. The analysis of the rotor includes nonlinear inertial and aerodynamic models, applicable to large blade angles and a high inflow ratio, The rotor aerodynamic model is based on two-dimensional steady airfoil characteristics with corrections for three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects, including a dynamic stall model. In the flutter analysis, the matrices are constructed that describe the linear differential equations of motion, and the equations are analyzed. In the flight dynamics analysis, the stability derivatives are calculated and the matrices are constructed that describe the linear differential equations of motion. These equations are analyzed. In the transient analysis, the rigid body equations of motion are numerically integrated, for a prescribed transient gust or control input. The CAMRAD program product is available by license for a period of ten years to domestic U.S. licensees. The licensed program product includes the CAMRAD source code, command procedures, sample applications, and one set of supporting documentation. Copies of the documentation may be purchased separately at the price indicated below. CAMRAD is written in FORTRAN 77 for the DEC VAX under VMS 4.6 with a recommended core memory of 4.04 megabytes. The DISSPLA package is necessary for graphical output. CAMRAD was developed in 1980.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model for a model-scale unmanned helicopter robot, with emphasis on the dynamics of the flybar. The interaction between the flybar and the main rotor blade is explained in detail; it is shown how the flapping of the flybar increases the stability of the helicopter robot as well as assists in its actuation. The model helicopter has a fast time-domain response due to its small size, and is inherently unstable. Therefore, most commercially available model helicopters use the flybar to augment stability and make it easier for a pilot to fly. Working from first principles and basic aerodynamics, the equations of motion for full six degree-of-freedom with flybar-degree of freedom are derived. System identification experiments and results are presented to verify the mathematical model structure and to identify model parameters such as inertias and aerodynamic constants.

Wireless communication uses ZigBee-based wireless devices which allow more efficient street lamp system management, thanks to an advanced interface and control architecture. It uses many sensors to control and guarantee the optimal system parameters; the information is transferred point-by-point using ZigBee transmitters and receivers and is sent to a control terminal used to check the state of the street lamps and to take appropriate measures in case of failure. The system allows substantial energy savings with increased performance and maintainability.},

abstract = {Quadcopter, also known as quadrotor, is a helicopter with four rotors. The rotors are directed upwards and they are placed in a square formation with equal distance from the center of mass of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is controlled by adjusting the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. Quadcopter is a typical design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) because of the simple structure. Quadcopters are used in surveillance, search and rescue, construction inspections and several other applications. Quadcopter has received considerable attention from researchers as the complex phenomena of the quadcopter has generated several areas of interest. The basic dynamical model of the quadcopter is the starting point for all of the studies but more complex aerodynamic properties has been introduced as well [1, 2]. Different control methods has been researched, including PID controllers [3, 4, 5, 6], backstepping control [7, 8], nonlinear H∞ control [9], LQR controllers [6], and nonlinear controllers with nested saturations [10, 11]. Control methods require accurate information from the position and attitude measurements performed with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and other measuring devices, such as GPS, and sonar and laser sensors [12, 13]. The purpose of this paper is to present the basics of quadcopter modelling and control as to form a basis for further research and development in the area. This is pursued with two aims. The first aim is to study the mathematical mo del of the quadcopter dynamics. The second aim is to develop proper methods for stabilisation and trajectory control of the quadcopter. The challenge in controlling a quadcopter is that the quadcopter has six degrees of freedom but there are only four control inputs. This paper presents the differential equations of the quadcopter dynamics. They are derived from both the Newton-Euler equations and the Euler-Lagrange equations which are both used in the study of quadcopters. The behaviour of the model is examined by simulating the flight of the quadcopter. Stabilisation of the quadcopter is conducted by utilising a PD controller. The PD controller is a simple con trol method which is easy to implement as the control method of the quadcopter. A simple heuristic method is developed to control the trajectory of the flight. Then a PD controller is integrated into the heuristic method to reduce the effect of the fluctuations in quadcopter behaviour caused by random external forces. The following section presents the mathematical model of a quadcopter. In the third section, the mathematical model is tested by simulating the quadcopter with given control inputs. The fourth section presents a PD controller to stabilise the quadcopter. In the fifth section, a heuristic method including a PD controller is presented to control the trajectory of quadcopter flight. The last section contains the conlusion of the paper.},

Often such situations are life-threatening and people cannot safely obtain such information. Disasters in urban ar- eas are particularly taxing. Structural collapse, dam- aged staircases and the loss communication infras- tructures aggravate rescue efforts. Robots, equipped with camera, can be employed to visually capture sit- uational awareness. As such, the focus of our work is designing a backpackable aerial robot that can hover- and-stare. Such a robot would ascend, peer through windows, and transmits video to an operator. This paper presents a backpackable tandem-rotor prototype that can carry a wireless camera.},
