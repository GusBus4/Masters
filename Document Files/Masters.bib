abstract = {An initial design concept for a micro-coaxial rotorcraft using custom manufacturing techniques and commercial off-the-shelf components is discussed. Issues associated with the feasibility of achieving hover and fully functional flight control at small scale for a coaxial rotor configuration are addressed. Results from this initial feasibility study suggest that it is possible to develop a small scale coaxial rotorcraft weighing approximately 100 gm, and that moment control is sufficient for roll, yaw and lateral trim. A prototype vehicle was built and its rotors were tested in a custom hover stand used to measure thrust and power. The best measured rotor Figure of Merit, 0.42, was obtained for a single rotor configuration. A blade element momentum theory (BEMT) model of the rotor was implemented, and airfoil characteristics were estimated from the rotor tests. The model showed that profile drag accounts for 45{\%} of the losses as opposed to 30{\%} in full-scale helicopters. The radio controlled vehicle was flown untethered with its own onboard power source and exhibited good flight stability and control dynamics.},

There are several models of the quadrotor that can be used to design a controller. The nonlinear model is presented with respect to the body-fixed frame and also to the inertial frame. The next model is defined in terms of quaternions. The last presented mathematical model is a model near a hover position, where some forces and moments can be neglected. Model parameters can be obtained via experimental identification, calculations or the combination of both ways. These parameters are arm length, total mass of the quadrotor, inertia matrix, friction coefficients, thrust coefficient and drag coefficient. Experimental identification of an actuator usually required the usage of a test bed.},

This tethered miniature robot (80g), which is autonomous in terms of its computational power requirements, is equipped with a 13.5-g quasi-panoramic visual system consisting of 4 individual visual motion sensors responding to the optic flow generated by photographs of natural scenes, thanks to the bio-inspired “time of travel” scheme. Based on recent findings on insects' sensing abilities and control strategies, the BeeRotor robot was designed to use optic flow to perform complex tasks such as ground and ceiling following while also automatically driving its forward speed on the basis of the ventral or dorsal optic flow. In addition, the BeeRotor robot can perform tricky manoeuvers such as automatic ceiling docking by simply regulating its dorsal or ventral optic flow in high-roofed tunnel depicting natural scenes. Although it was built as a proof of concept, the BeeRotor robot is one step further towards achieving a fully-autonomous micro-helicopter which is capable of navigating mainly on the basis of the optic flo},

The control performance is studied by real time implementation of the control algorithms in an actual helicopter testbed. Since the decoupling matrix of the model helicopter is singular, the system is not decouplable by static state feedback, and it is challenging to design a feedback control system. Dynamic state feedback is applied. The controller is designed using a nonlinear structure algorithm. Furthermore, a parameter identification scheme is introduced in the closed-loop system to improve the control performance. Three identification methods are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@unpublished{Camrad,
abstract = {The Comprehensive Analytical Model of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics, CAMRAD, program is designed to calculate rotor performance, loads, and noise; helicopter vibration and gust response; flight dynamics and handling qualities; and system aeroelastic stability. The analysis is a consistent combination of structural, inertial, and aerodynamic models applicable to a wide range of problems and a wide class of vehicles. The CAMRAD analysis can be applied to articulated, hingeless, gimballed, and teetering rotors with an arbitrary number of blades. The rotor degrees of freedom included are blade/flap bending, rigid pitch and elastic torsion, and optionally gimbal or teeter motion. General two-rotor aircrafts can be modeled. Single main-rotor and tandem helicopter and sideby-side tilting proprotor aircraft configurations can be considered. The case of a rotor or helicopter in a wind tunnel can also be modeled. The aircraft degrees of freedom included are the six rigid body motion, elastic airframe motions, and the rotor/engine speed perturbations. CAMRAD calculates the load and motion of helicopters and airframes in two stages. First the trim solution is obtained; then the flutter, flight dynamics, and/or transient behavior can be calculated. The trim operating conditions considered include level flight, steady climb or descent, and steady turns. The analysis of the rotor includes nonlinear inertial and aerodynamic models, applicable to large blade angles and a high inflow ratio, The rotor aerodynamic model is based on two-dimensional steady airfoil characteristics with corrections for three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects, including a dynamic stall model. In the flutter analysis, the matrices are constructed that describe the linear differential equations of motion, and the equations are analyzed. In the flight dynamics analysis, the stability derivatives are calculated and the matrices are constructed that describe the linear differential equations of motion. These equations are analyzed. In the transient analysis, the rigid body equations of motion are numerically integrated, for a prescribed transient gust or control input. The CAMRAD program product is available by license for a period of ten years to domestic U.S. licensees. The licensed program product includes the CAMRAD source code, command procedures, sample applications, and one set of supporting documentation. Copies of the documentation may be purchased separately at the price indicated below. CAMRAD is written in FORTRAN 77 for the DEC VAX under VMS 4.6 with a recommended core memory of 4.04 megabytes. The DISSPLA package is necessary for graphical output. CAMRAD was developed in 1980.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model for a model-scale unmanned helicopter robot, with emphasis on the dynamics of the flybar. The interaction between the flybar and the main rotor blade is explained in detail; it is shown how the flapping of the flybar increases the stability of the helicopter robot as well as assists in its actuation. The model helicopter has a fast time-domain response due to its small size, and is inherently unstable. Therefore, most commercially available model helicopters use the flybar to augment stability and make it easier for a pilot to fly. Working from first principles and basic aerodynamics, the equations of motion for full six degree-of-freedom with flybar-degree of freedom are derived. System identification experiments and results are presented to verify the mathematical model structure and to identify model parameters such as inertias and aerodynamic constants.

@article{Luukkonen,
abstract = {Quadcopter, also known as quadrotor, is a helicopter with four rotors. The rotors are directed upwards and they are placed in a square formation with equal distance from the center of mass of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is controlled by adjusting the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. Quadcopter is a typical design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) because of the simple structure. Quadcopters are used in surveillance, search and rescue, construction inspections and several other applications. Quadcopter has received considerable attention from researchers as the complex phenomena of the quadcopter has generated several areas of interest. The basic dynamical model of the quadcopter is the starting point for all of the studies but more complex aerodynamic properties has been introduced as well [1, 2]. Different control methods has been researched, including PID controllers [3, 4, 5, 6], backstepping control [7, 8], nonlinear H∞ control [9], LQR controllers [6], and nonlinear controllers with nested saturations [10, 11]. Control methods require accurate information from the position and attitude measurements performed with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and other measuring devices, such as GPS, and sonar and laser sensors [12, 13]. The purpose of this paper is to present the basics of quadcopter modelling and control as to form a basis for further research and development in the area. This is pursued with two aims. The first aim is to study the mathematical mo del of the quadcopter dynamics. The second aim is to develop proper methods for stabilisation and trajectory control of the quadcopter. The challenge in controlling a quadcopter is that the quadcopter has six degrees of freedom but there are only four control inputs. This paper presents the differential equations of the quadcopter dynamics. They are derived from both the Newton-Euler equations and the Euler-Lagrange equations which are both used in the study of quadcopters. The behaviour of the model is examined by simulating the flight of the quadcopter. Stabilisation of the quadcopter is conducted by utilising a PD controller. The PD controller is a simple con trol method which is easy to implement as the control method of the quadcopter. A simple heuristic method is developed to control the trajectory of the flight. Then a PD controller is integrated into the heuristic method to reduce the effect of the fluctuations in quadcopter behaviour caused by random external forces. The following section presents the mathematical model of a quadcopter. In the third section, the mathematical model is tested by simulating the quadcopter with given control inputs. The fourth section presents a PD controller to stabilise the quadcopter. In the fifth section, a heuristic method including a PD controller is presented to control the trajectory of quadcopter flight. The last section contains the conlusion of the paper.},

abstract = {— We consider the problem of estimating the wind velocity perceived by a flying multicopter, from data acquired by onboard sensors and knowledge of its aerodynamics model only. We employ two complementary methods. The first is based on the estimation of the external wrench (force and torque) due to aerodynamics acting on the robot in flight. Wind velocity is obtained by inverting an identified model of the aerodynamic forces. The second method is based on the estimation of the propeller aerodynamic power, and provides an estimate independent of other sensors. We show how to calculate components of the wind velocity using multiple aerodynamic power measurements, when the poses between them are known. The method uses the motor current and angular velocity as measured by the electronic speed controllers, essentially using the propellers as wind sensors. Verification of the methods and model identification were done using measurements acquired during autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel.},
