\chapter{Obstacle Avoidance Implementation}
	
	The first section will discuss modelling this environment. the second section in this chapter will discuss the mathematical modelling of these sensors for the purpose of the simulation. 
	
	\section{Mathematical modelling}
		
		\subsection{World Creation}
		In order to correctly model the system, a thorough system identification needs to be completed. This entails real world measurements of the chosen platform. The methods and results from these experiments are covered in this section.
