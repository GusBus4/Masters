\chapter{Simulated Flight Tests}

	\section{Aims and Objectives}
	Simple waypoint flight with the presence of wind and gusts and all noises - Shows completely controlled system with the ability to counter act all disturbances and impurities
	
	Fly directly at an obstacle and stop forward velocity step, move into the obstacle avoidance section
	
	Successfully navigate down a corridor maintaining equidistance from the walls, no bank with wind - Shows completely integrated system capable of withstanding large disturbances for simple manoeuvres
	
	Successfully navigate down a corridor maintaining equidistance from the walls, with bank no wind - shows the ability of the obstacle avoidance integrated with the position controller and the yaw alignment can succesfully navigate based on limited information
	Add in comparison to non yaw alignment. Add in wide zig zag corridor.
	
	Fly around the course while missing all the obstacles and completing the mission - shows ability to complete complex manoeuvres and navigate a complex course without collisions
	
	Show local minima, where it cannot achieve it's goal - limitations of the design, calling for a higher route planning algorithm
